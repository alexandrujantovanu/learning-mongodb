Work with previous imported data for usersdb.

Drop database:
db.dropDatabase()

Delete filtered document:
db.users.deleteMany({age: {$gt: 30}, isSporty: true})

Exists doesn't find fields with values set to null:
db.users.deleteMany({age: {$exists: false})   

Delete all docs in a collection:
db.users.deleteMany({})
Only for dev purpose: db.users.drop()
